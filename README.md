#  Age & Gender Estimation using Custom CNN & Transfer Learning

This repository contains my dual-approach project on predicting **Age** and classifying **Gender** from facial images. It includes:

- A **Custom CNN model** built from scratch
- A **Transfer Learning model** using VGG16

The project showcases the differences in performance, complexity, and flexibility between these two deep learning approaches.

##  Project Overview

###  Objectives:
-  Predict **Age** (regression)
-  Classify **Gender** (binary classification)

###  Two Models Implemented:
1. **Model A:** Custom CNN architecture built from scratch
2. **Model B:** Fine-tuned VGG16 model (Transfer Learning)

Both models share a **dual-output structure**, meaning they learn to predict age and gender simultaneously.

##  Model Architecture

### Custom CNN:
- Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU and MaxPooling
- Batch Normalisation & Dropout for regularisation
- Dual output branches:
  - Age regression (linear activation)
  - Gender classification (sigmoid activation)

### Transfer Learning (VGG16):
- Pretrained VGG16 (ImageNet weights, no top)
- Custom dense layers stacked on top
- Fine-tuned final few layers
- Dual output branches (same as above)
